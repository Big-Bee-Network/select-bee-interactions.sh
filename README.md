[![GloBI Review by Elton](../../actions/workflows/review.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/review.yml)

Uses [select-bee-interactions.sh](select-bee-interactions.sh) to filter verbatim interactions indexed by GloBI to include only names known to the DiscoverLife Bee Checklist.

Two examples are included that demonstrate the outcomes of running this script against GloBI Interpreted Data Products v0.6 and v0.7 [1,2] in [2023-08-25](examples/2023-08-25) and [2024-06-07](examples/2024-06-07) respectively. 

This includes [`bees-only-interactions.tsv.gz`](examples/2024-06-07/bees-only-interactions.tsv.gz) as generated by running:

```
../select-bee-interactions.sh\
 | gzip\
 > bees-only-interactions.tsv.gz
```

For each example, a GloBI index configuration (e.g., [globi.json](examples/2024-06-07/globi.json)) was created to enable an automated data review of this specific subset of GloBI-indexed biotic interactions. Please inspect the [GitHub Actions configuration](.github/actions/review.yml) if you'd like to learn more about this automated review process.
