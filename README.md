[![GloBI Review by Elton](../../actions/workflows/review.yml/badge.svg)](../../actions/workflows/review.yml)

Uses [select-bee-interactions.sh](select-bee-interactions.sh) to filter verbatim interactions indexed by GloBI to include only names known to the DiscoverLife Bee Checklist.

The included [`bee-interactions.tsv.gz`](bee-interactions.tsv.gz) was generated by running:

```
./select-bee-interactions.sh\
 | gzip\
 > bee-interactions.tsv.gz
```

A GloBI index configuration [globi.json](globi.json) was created to enable an automated data review of this specific subset of GloBI-indexed biotic interactions.
